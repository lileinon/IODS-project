*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your GitHub repository here. This is an R Markdown (.Rmd) file so you should use R Markdown syntax.*

Feeling a little bewildered. Lots to take in. Had forgotten about the syntax of R, been years since last time since I used it. The intro throught the book was thorough, but reading is for not the same as hands-on when it comes to coding. At least the book works as a good source for reference in the future.
